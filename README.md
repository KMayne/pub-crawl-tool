# pub-crawl-tool
##### A web app for tracking points on the 2018 circle line pub crawl.

For a bit of fun, we had point penalties for things (e.g. losing something) on
our pub crawl. This tool was created by me in about 14 hours to track those points.

## Running

Simply install the dependencies and run the start script:
```
npm install
npm start
```

To use the site, follow the link that is printed when you start the server then
add a user in the admin page. You should then copy the generated link and
visit it to update the key your browser holds.

## Future Development
Before the next pub crawl, I'll probably add a schedule & tracking/reminder function.
